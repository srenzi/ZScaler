# ZScaler

This is a small set of script to easily enable and disable ZScaler using the command line in your Linux box.

#Install

This will disable the ZScaler services on startup and create symbolic links to the executables to `/usr/local/bin/` so that they can be invoked from anywhere

#Usage

Run `noVPN` to disconnect from the VPN.
